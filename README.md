This is the source code. I am not the owner nor the creator of this mod. All credit goes to spacechase0 and his repository. This is a fork for those of you wishing to use this mod on Stardew Valley v1.1 NOTE: Will work with all map types, but requires a new save or a save with no house upgrades. 

Download: https://www.dropbox.com/s/a6ux4btqlassevx/StardewValleyMP_Fork_1.1_v0.2.5.zip?dl=0

Dependencies: SMAPI v0.4.0.1 ALPHA Stardew Valley v1.1

Known errors: 
You must start with a new save file, or one that does not have any house upgrades. I do not know if house upgrades themselves are the culprit or just loading the upgrades. I highly doubt the basement house upgrade works as of now.
